## Xfce Terminal

## Eclipse
It is recommend to use the Eclipse Color Themes plugin. It allows easy switching between different themes:

## Adding the Smyck-Theme to Xcode 4

Navigate to your Color-Themes directory
<<<<<<< .merge_file_oFifVZ

	~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes

and add the file named 'Smyck.dvcolortheme'. 


# Disclaimer
=======

	~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes

and add the file named 'Smyck.dvcolortheme'. 

>>>>>>> .merge_file_z07jkO
If you haven't made any changes to a theme so far, the directory might not exist yet! In that case, just create a folder named 'FontAndColorThemes' in Xcode/UserData and add the 'Smyck.dvcolortheme' file.
 
If opened, restart Xcode. Then go to:

	Preferences | Fonts & Colors

and select 'Smyck' in the sidebar on the left.

Enjoy!

## Coda 2

In Coda 2, go to

	Preferences | Colors

click the little gearwheel-icon. Then click on "Import" and navigate to the Smyck.sss file you just downloaded! 

To get the best results, I additionally recommend setting your Font-size to "Menlo, Bold, 13". To do that, just go to the "Editor"-Tab in the preferences menu and change the "Editor Font". 

Enjoy!
